## About

Hey friend! Thanks for showing interest in the dis-orientation guide (DOG) working group at CMU! 
We think we're pretty cool as we try to work on lots of issues at once!
But some specific issues that activist groups at CMU is working on is 
[divestment] (https://www.facebook.com/DivestCMU), Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe Solidarity, 
[banning bottled water campaign] (https://www.facebook.com/tbttcmich), and much more. 

We're pretty new in working with the Dis-Orientation Collective, 
and have only released [the first issue] (http://cmu.dis-orientation.info/cmu-dogs/CMUDOGISSUE1DIVESTMENT.pdf) of the Dis-Orientation Guide (DOG), 
and are working on getting [Issue 2] (http://cmu.dis-orientation.info/dogs/) out ASAP!
